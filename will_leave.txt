Dear William,

I am so sad to see you leave on Saturday 1/10/2020,
I have had a ball with you here, as I write this to you I have tears
in my eyes, I can honestly say I have NEVER had tears i my eyes seeing you leave
going to school or on a internship. But seeing how you have tutored me over these past 
4 weeks and hearing how yo tutored those kids, and I know how much you care!  That's the
thing that hits me the most seeing how much you care about anything you put your mind to,
not even knowing what the end result will b, BUT you always trust it will work out,
THAT's where GOD comes in!  I see you studying so hard, my GOD!!!!!
I can't explain to you how proud I am to call you my SON!
I just hopoe your Son/Daughter brings you as much "proudness", ( totally not a word)
I can tell you I have tears running down my face as I sit here at work.
I have never seen anyone work as hard as you!
I just want to thank you for studying Python and Linux, I know you did it ALL for me
maybe a little for you but I know you wanted to tutor me so you studied up!!

Sorry to go on and on, but I really love you 
and keep up the good work!
Remember try to find some time to enjoy some part of your day/week/month/year!
Try to make 2020 an enjoyable year for yourself- you already have
 the school/Career thing down packed.
